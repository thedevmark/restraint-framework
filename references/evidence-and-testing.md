# Evidence and Testing Reference

Use this reference when implementing, auditing, or verifying a visual or content change. It keeps taste judgment, source inspection, and automated testing from being confused with one another.

## Keep three evidence lanes separate

### Human critique

Judge task clarity, hierarchy, composition, voice, emotional fit, product specificity, and whether the design feels earned. A linter or screenshot diff cannot make this judgment.

### Source audit

Confirm content, semantics, design tokens, component contracts, DOM order, routes, state coverage, and code-level patterns. Source can prove what was implemented, but not always how it reads optically.

### Rendered and behavioral evidence

Inspect pixels, wrapping, contrast, focus, motion, interaction, and complete states in a real browser or faithful component environment. This is where source assumptions meet actual behavior.

Keep findings labeled:

- **source-confirmed** — directly established by code or product content;
- **render-observed** — visible in the inspected artifact;
- **test-confirmed** — reproduced by an executed check or user path;
- **inferred** — plausible but not yet verified.

## Respect project authority

- Inspect the repository's style guide, `DESIGN.md`, tokens, shared components, stories, tests, and nearby usage before inventing a local rule.
- Treat design tokens and documented component contracts as normative until evidence shows drift or an intentional migration.
- Treat rationale and examples as context. Verify that current implementation still matches them.
- Preserve unknown sections and authored decisions. Do not create, replace, or broadly rewrite design documentation during a scoped UI cleanup unless asked.
- Prefer the project's configured tools. Do not install axe, Storybook, a prose linter, or a visual-regression service merely because it could be useful.

## Review in a useful order

1. Read the artifact and make an independent design and content assessment.
2. Inspect source, tokens, component contracts, and real states.
3. Run the project's relevant static, prose, or accessibility checks.
4. Render representative states and widths.
5. Exercise the changed user path with keyboard and pointer input.
6. Compare visual baselines only after the page is stable.

This order prevents a detector from deciding what the reviewer is allowed to notice. Merge the lanes only when prioritizing the final corrections.

## Build a representative state matrix

Cover the changed surface rather than mechanically multiplying every possible combination.

| Axis | Representative cases |
| --- | --- |
| Content | empty, typical, long, dense, missing or unavailable |
| State | default, hover, focus, active, loading, error, success, disabled |
| Width | narrow mobile, common laptop, wide only when behavior changes |
| Input | keyboard and pointer; touch when the interaction differs |
| Preference | reduced motion, zoom/reflow, every supported theme |
| Locale | text expansion, locale formats, right-to-left when relevant |
| Data | zero, missing, thin-sample, delayed, stale, or permission-blocked when real |

Choose cases that threaten the design's assumptions. A single ideal-data desktop screenshot proves very little.

## Stabilize visual evidence

Before relying on a screenshot or pixel diff:

- fix the viewport, device scale, browser, theme, locale, timezone, and operating environment;
- wait for fonts, images, application hydration, and meaningful network requests;
- freeze clocks, random values, animation, carousels, cursors, and changing data where the existing test stack permits it;
- seed or mock data deliberately and label it as fixture data;
- wait for the specific ready state, not an arbitrary sleep;
- capture the same route, authentication state, and component state;
- compare baselines produced in a compatible environment.

Mask only nondeterministic regions that are irrelevant to the assertion. Do not mask a real defect, hide half the page, or loosen thresholds until a change disappears.

A visual baseline can preserve an existing bad design. Review the baseline itself before accepting it as truth.

## Test behavior, not only appearance

- Follow the complete path from arrival through action, loading, success or failure, and return.
- Assert the result of an action, not just that a control received a click.
- Test recovery, preserved input, retry, cancel, undo, and destructive consequences where they exist.
- Verify duplicate submission prevention without making the interface a silent dead end.
- Test content revealed by menus, dialogs, tabs, accordions, tooltips, toasts, validation, and asynchronous updates.
- Confirm that responsive reordering preserves reading and focus order.

Component stories are useful for controlled state coverage. Page and end-to-end tests remain necessary for layout relationships, routing, focus transitions, and real workflows.

## Test accessibility by state and pattern

- Run the project's existing automated accessibility checks after each important state becomes visible; hidden menus, dialogs, errors, and toasts are not covered by an initial-page scan.
- Review every automated **incomplete** or manual-review result instead of treating it as a pass.
- Test keyboard reachability, visible focus, logical focus order, focus trapping and return, escape behavior, announcements, names, descriptions, landmarks, headings, contrast, zoom, and reflow.
- Use native HTML when it satisfies the interaction.
- For a custom composite widget, follow the exact WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices pattern for roles, states, properties, focus management, and keys. Dialog, combobox, menu, tab, grid, and tree behavior are not interchangeable.
- Check that the visual state and accessibility state agree. Do not mark a dialog modal, a control disabled, or an item selected unless it behaves that way for every user.

Automated accessibility results are a floor. They do not prove keyboard usability, screen-reader comprehension, cognitive clarity, or that the right pattern was chosen.

## Use automation without outsourcing judgment

Use existing tools for the evidence they can actually produce:

- prose linters: mechanics, configured terminology, repetition, risky phrases;
- static design detectors: code-level defaults, token drift, possible overflow, repeated styling patterns;
- axe-style checks: deterministic WCAG and best-practice violations in rendered states;
- component stories: controlled props, content, states, and interaction cases;
- visual regression: unintended rendered changes against a reviewed baseline;
- end-to-end tests: task completion and cross-component behavior.

No clean result proves that copy is human, the design is specific, the hierarchy is right, or the product claim is true. Investigate false positives and false negatives before changing the artifact to please the tool.

## Report verification precisely

State exactly what ran and what did not:

- commands, tests, stories, routes, states, viewports, and browsers inspected;
- whether screenshots were visually reviewed or only generated;
- whether accessibility was automated, manual, or both;
- whether content was checked in source, rendered context, or the full flow;
- remaining inferred risks and untested states.

Fix findings in one coherent batch, then use at most one confirmation pass. If a tool is unavailable or the environment cannot render faithfully, say so instead of upgrading inference into proof.
